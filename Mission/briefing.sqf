player createDiaryRecord["Wasteland", [
"Hints & Tips",
"At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies before worrying about where to establish a meeting place or a base, supplies are important and very valuable.<br/><br/>
When picking a base location, it is best advised to pick a place that is out of the way and not so obvious such as airports, cities, castles, etc. remember, players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base should you set it up in a town.<br/><br/>
If you spawn in an area with no vehicles or supplies in the immediate area, DO NOT just click respawn from the pause menu, chances are if you search an area of a few hundred meters, you will find something.<br/><br/>
Always be on the lookout for nightvision. Two pairs are located in the Large Cache, and there are pairs scattered throughout cars. You can also purchase them from the gunstores. Nighttime without them SUCKS, and if you have them, you can conduct stealth raids on enemy bases under the cover of complete darkness.<br/><br/>
When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded, one guard will suffice, but it is recommended you have at least 2, maybe 3 guards at base at all times.<br/><br/>
There are very aggressive AI characters that spawn with most side missions and will protect the mission objectives with deadly force, be aware of them.<br/>"
]];

player CreateDiaryRecord["Wasteland", [
"Welcome to Wasteland!",
"Wasteland is a team versus team versus team sandbox survival experience. The objective of this mission is to rally your faction / group members, scavenge weapons, base parts and vehicles, and use them destroy other groups / factions. This server is armor focused, so expect to encounter a lot of tanks and armored personel carriers! It is survival of the fittest! Please keep in mind that this is a work in progress. Have fun!

FAQ<br/>
Q. Where can I get a gun?<br/>
A. Weapons are found in a number of different places:<br/>
	- In weapon caches that randomly spawn in towns.<br/>
	- Inside the gear of vehicles.<br/>
	- Weapons can be purchased from one of many gun stores scattered around the map.<br/>
	- On the corpses of dead players or AI at missions.<br/>
<br/>
Q. What are the circles on the map?<br/>
A. The circles represent town and store limits. The circle will appear green if friendly units are present, red if enemies are present and orange if both enemy and friendly units are present. If friendly soldiers are in range of a town, you can spawn there from the re-spawn menu; however if there is an enemy presence, you will not be able to spawn there.<br/>
<br/>
Q. Is it ok for me to shoot my team mates?<br/>
A. If you are member of BLUFOR or OPFOR teams, then you are not allowed to shoot or steam items and vehicles from your teammates. If you play as Independent, you are free to engage anyone as well as team up with anyone you want.<br/>
<br/>
Q. I saw someone breaking a rule, what do I do?<br/>
A. If you wish to report an incident or concern, please join our TeamSpeak server at ts.eventhorizongaming.net and report it to a server administrator / moderator. If no admins are available, please visit our website at http://www.eventhorizongaming.net and submit a report. Please provide as much evidence as you can to enforce your report, whether it be screenshots, recorded video footage, chat logs, etc.<br/>"
